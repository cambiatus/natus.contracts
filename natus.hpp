     * Table that holds information about all Natus Units
     * Natus Unit is a digital good that represents a basket of services provided by a given RPPN (see links below) in a given period called `harvest`
     * 
     * What can you do with it?
     * Like any digital good Natus Units can be exchanged between users.
     * You can also choose to plant it. It will be in cultivation phase and will yield the planter a reward in the next harvest.
     * Planted Natus U are cannot be exchanged anymore and represent a commitment with the land and nature represented by the Natus Unit
     * 
     * Here is a general description of available fields on a Natus Unit:
     * 
     * * id: ID
     * * owner: Current owner 
     * * origin: RPPN ID
     * * harvest: Period of harvest, usually happens on 365 days cycle but not always
     * * report_hash: Hash for the full report document, used to garantee authenticity of the document
     * * biome: RPPN's biome
     * * location: RPPN's location using latitude and longitude
     * * planted_date: Date it was planted, its empty if it is still not planted
