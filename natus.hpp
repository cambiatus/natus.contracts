/**
 * This contract describe the rules and behaviors for Natus Unit. 
 * Natus Unit is a digital good that represents the services provided by nature within a PPA (Private Protected Area)
 * 
 * This is an effort to bring funds to those areas to help it grow an be preserved.
 * With the funds obtained from the Natus Unit project, PPAs can study their land, discover what ecossystem services nature provide.
 * That data allow measure of the production of those ecossystem services.
 * Each year Natus Foundation measure that production and generate Natus Units, that comes from the PPAs, that measure is called `harvest`
 * 
 * # What can you do with it?
 * 
 * Like any digital good Natus Units can be exchanged between users.
 * You can also choose to plant it. It will be in cultivation phase and will yield the planter a reward in the next harvest.
 * Planted Natus U are cannot be exchanged anymore and represent a commitment with the land and nature represented by the Natus Unit
